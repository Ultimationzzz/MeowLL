# MeowLL

MeowLL is a small utility that can convert MeowFace tracking data to the LiveLink protocol. LiveLink can be used for many things with Unreal Engine, however one of the uses are to handle motion capture data.

This utility was mainly designed to work with MikoVerse but it may work with other VR applications created in Unreal Engine too.

The sofware will work under windows - feel free to clone the repository and port to linux
